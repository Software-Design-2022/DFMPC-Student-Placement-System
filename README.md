# DFMPC-Student-Placement-System

## Project Description
- Student Mobile App(SPS) - A student app which integrates with the student Placement System. The app will need to accomodate any student needs and any relevant information on the system needs to be presented to students via app. For example, the app may need to present the student with their schedule for a specific Block.
- 
## User Stories 
- As a medical student user, I should be able to insert my student email and the corresponding password to access my student placement application.
- As a medical student user, logged into the student placement application, I should always have immediate access to a panic button for emergencies.
- As a medical student, I should be able to access a schedules sections that allow me to see where my next placement will be, duties for that placement, and the duration of the placement.
- Being a medical student, I should be able to communicate with my supervisors and contact my clinical officers from the app.
- As a medical student, I should be able to log any academic disclaims for any pupils that are academically dishonest.

## User Acceptance Test
- Given I am the medical student and I have the correct student email and corresponding password then I should be able to log into my student placement account on the application.
- Given I am the medical student, when I am already logged into my account and on any interface of the app, then I should be able to click on a panic button on emergencies.
-  Given that I am the medical student, when I am logged into my student placement account, then I should be able to access a schedule section from the dashboard to see the location of my next placement and it's duration. 
-  Given I am the medical student, when I am logged into the app then I should have the ability to communicate with my supervisors and and contact my clinical officers.
-  Given that I am the medical student when  logged into my student placement account, then I should be able to log any academic disclaims for any pupils that are academically dishonest.
